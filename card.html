			   <p>Squirrels have four front teeth that never stop growing so they don't wear down from the constant gnawing. 
                  Tree squirrels are the types most commonly recognized, often seen gracefully scampering and leaping from branch to branch. 
                  Other species are ground squirrels that live in burrow or tunnel systems, where some hibernate during the winter season.</p>
